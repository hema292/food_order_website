“In this project, I developed a dynamic food ordering website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to browse a list of food items, each displayed with comprehensive details such as name, price, and rating. To enhance the user experience, I implemented an interactive toggle heart-shaped button for adding items to the cart, providing immediate visual feedback.

The cart functionality is fully dynamic—users can add or remove items on the fly, and the total price updates automatically to reflect these changes. Additionally, I included a feature for users to input their delivery address, ensuring a complete ordering flow. Overall, the project showcases my ability to build interactive, user-friendly e-commerce interfaces with dynamic cart management.”
